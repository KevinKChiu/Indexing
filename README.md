# Indexing
All the code for this project is in the src folder. 
The src folder contains two java files: "Indexing.java" and "Posting.java"
"Indexing.java" contains the majority of the code for this project and the indexing process.
"Posting.java" contains the Posting class I used as a Posting data structure for the indexing process.
I coded and ran this project using the Eclipse IDE and utilized the json-simple library.
